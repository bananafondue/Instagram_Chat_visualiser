# Instagram_Chat_visualiser

This is the Instagram chat-data visualizer that I made with Python. 
It shows the user the statistics of the conversation like number of words, percentage of involvement from both the sides through graphs. The user can also search for a word or emoji to find the number of occurrences.  
The JSON module is used to interact with the raw data, Qt for the GUI and Matplotlib for the graphs.

Currently it works on 1920 x 1080 screens only as the dimensions of elements are fixed and not dynamic.
